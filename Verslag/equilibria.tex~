\section{Investigating the equilibria}

First, we will locate the equilibria of this system.  Note that we
will take the parameters $a, b \neq 0$ and $\rho,\sigma > 0$.  This
will greatly simplify the solutions.

Equating the right part of equation \ref{eq:system} with zero, we get
from the $z'$ part, noting that $b \neq 0$, that $y = 0$.
Furthermore, the second equation tells us then that $z = -x$.  And
lastly, the first equation tells us to look for the roots of
$\phi(x)$.  We will factor this into:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:phi-factor}
  \phi(x) = x ( \rho x^2 - \sigma ) = 0,
\end{equation}
from which we deduce that $x = 0$ or $x = \pm
\sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\rho}}$.

This leaves us with three equilibrium points for the system:
\begin{align}
  X_0 &= (x,y,z)_0 &= (0,0,0)\\
  X_\pm &=(x,y,z)_\pm &= (\pm\sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\rho}}, 0,
  \mp\sqrt{\frac{\sigma}{\rho}})
\end{align}

\subsection{Classification}

We will now linearize the system about the equilibria and classify
these points on this.  For
