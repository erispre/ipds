\section{Mathematica scripts}

We used the following script with Wolfram Mathematica 7.0 to determine
which eigenvalues are possible for the linearized system.  This is the
version used for the origin.  Note that it can simply be modified to
determine the behaviour for the other equilibria.

It works by computing the characteristic polynomial of the linearized
system and making an assumption about the nature of its roots.  Then,
by comparing the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial and the
expanded factorization, it deduces a set of requirements on the
parameters for the system to be consistent.  It then attempts to find
a set of parameters for which certain restrictions on the eigenvalues
hold.  If no such set exists, it returns an empty list.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Mathematica]
Clear[a, b, n]
m = {{-2 a n, a, 0}, {1, -1, 1}, {0, -b, 0}};
m // MatrixForm
match = And @@ (Equal @@@ 
    Transpose[{CoefficientList[Expand[k (l - x) (l - y) (l - z)], l], 
      CoefficientList[CharacteristicPolynomial[m, l], l]}])
FindInstance[
 match && a > 0 && b > 0 && n > 0 && x < 0 && y < 0 && z < 0, {a, b, 
  n, x, y, z, k}]
\end{lstlisting}
